# Merch

Merch is an online marketplace that allows users to list items for sale and browse a diverse range of products offered by other users. Whether you're looking to sell your items or discover new ones, Merch provides a user-friendly platform to connect buyers and sellers.

## FEATURES

### User Profiles: Create a profile page to include important contact information and view wallet credits. This page also has a transaction history to view the user's previous purchases and sales.

### Buy page: Users are able to browse through a list of all items sold on the marketplace. The search bar also allows users to filter through specific items they are looking for.

### Sell page: Users are able to create new listings to be put up for sale in other user's buy page. They are also able to update or delete any current listing here.

### Admin Controls: Admins have the authority to delete existing user accounts.

When visiting the site without logging in, users will only be able to browse through the buy page, which lists all items for sale but are unable to purchase without creating an account.
